<p><h1><font color ="red">What is Lorem Ipsum?</font></h1>

<b><i>Lorem Ipsum</i></b> is <u>simply</u> dummy text of the <sub>printing</sub> and <strong>typesetting industry</strong>. <sup>Lorem Ipsum</sup> has been <em>the industry's</em> standard<br> dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer <font size="20px" face="verdana">took a galley</font> of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also<br> the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more<br> recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><hr>

<p><h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less<br> normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem<br> Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by<br> accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
